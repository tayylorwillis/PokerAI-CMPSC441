""""
Goals for game_logic:
generate player hands
assign hands to players
detect hand types (ace high)
get_hand()
initiate who starts (not our agent for now)
operate the changing of turns
take_turn() func
call()
fold()
raise()
user prompting for user turn
mode setting for bot v bot or bot v user?
initialize starting money, will use a var for now,
take prompt from user later
ace 14 for now, add is_ace later

NOT: (this is a note to self because I Stew 
struggle to remember what goes where and will
start putting everything here otherwise)
win likelihood for bot logic
turn logic/decision making for bot
